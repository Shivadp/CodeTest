# CodeTest

This program prints numbers from 1 to 100 

Print out all positive integers from 1 to 100, inclusive and in order.
▪ Print messages to standard output, matching the Sample Output below.
▪ In the output, state whether the each integer is 'odd' or 'even' in the output.
▪ If the number is divisible by three, instead of stating that the number is odd or even, state
that the number is 'divisible by three'.
▪ If the number is divisible by both two and three, instead of saying that the number is odd,
even or divisible by three; state that the number is 'divisible by two and three'.
▪ Design the logic of the loop to be as efficient as possible, using the minimal number of operations to perform the
required logic.
